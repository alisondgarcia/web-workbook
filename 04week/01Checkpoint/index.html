      <p>Local teen Josuke Higashikata investigates a string of murders and discovers the killer.
        Previously Josuke was somewhat of a delinquent, often getting into small money making schemes
        and pranks. He soon learned that he had a unique power called a "stand" and that there were other
        people like him in the town, including his nephew Jotaro, classmates Koichi and Okuyasu, and
        the snarky famous mangaka Rohan.

         <h1>Jotaro</h1>
           <p>Josuke met his nephew under strange circumstances... His father was having an
             affair with a Japanese woman several decades younger than him, thus the 12 year age-gap
             between Josuke and his nephew Jotaro. Jotaro is a stoic man who is studying to earn his
             PhD in marine biology.

       <div class="Oku">
         <h1>Okuyasu</h1>
         <p>Okuyasu is a young delinquent boy with a tragic past. He lost his older brother
           and lives with his physically incapacitated father in a dilapidated, abandoned house
           in town. In spite of his difficult life, Oku is a deeply affectionate and trusting person.
           He's Josuke's best friend and right-hand man.

       <div class="Rohan">
         <h1>Rohan</h1>
         <p>Rohan is a local comic book artist and writer (a mangaka). He's sort of a shit
           but he helps Josuke and the crew track down the killer and solve the mystery with
           his intelligence and keen observational skills.
