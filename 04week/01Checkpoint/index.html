        <h2><strong>Two Great Tastes that Taste Great Together</strong></h2>
        <p>Local teen Josuke Higashikata investigates a string of murders and discovers the killer.
          Previously Josuke was somewhat of a delinquent, often getting into small money making schemes and pranks.
          He soon learned that he had a unique power called a "stand" and that there were other people like him in the town, including his nephew Jotaro,
          classmates Koichi and Okuyasu, and the snarky famous mangaka Rohan.
        </p>
      <br>

      <p>Josuke met his nephew under strange circumstances... His father was having an affair with a Japanese
        woman several decades younger than him, thus the 12 year age-gap between Josuke and his nephew Jotaro.
        Jotaro is a stoic man who is studying to earn his PhD in marine biology.
      </p>
       <br>

      <p>Koichi is an innocent boy with the heart of a lion. He joins Josuke after he discovers his own dormant
        "stand" ability. He is generally kind, thoughtful, and somewhat neurotic.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>Okuyasu is a young delinquent boy with a tragic past. He lost his older brother and lives
        with his physically incapacitated father in a dilapidated, abandoned house in town. In spite of his
        difficult life, Oku is a deeply affectionate and trusting person. He's Josuke's best friend and right-hand man.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>Rohan is a local comic book artist and writer (a mangaka). He's sort of a shit but he helps Josuke and the
        crew track down the killer and solve the mystery with his intelligence and keen observational skills.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>The real heart of the adventure is Hayato, a young boy who discovers that the killer is his father.
        He tracks down Josuke and the rest of the crew and manages to outwit his devious father to boot.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>Kira Yoshikage is an evil man who is responsible for the murders of several men and women in the small
        town of Morioh. He was able to blend in with society due to his mild-mannerisms and David Bowie-like charisma.
        He was found out by the clever and brave Hayato, and brought down by the rest of the crew.
      </p>
