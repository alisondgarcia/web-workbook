        <h2><strong>Local Woman Finds Success in Web Development</strong></h2>
        <p>Alison Dorantes-Garcia, a 28 year-old woman from Watsonville, CA,
      has finally broken out of her slump and found success in web development.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Alison went to college in the San Francisco Bay Area, initially intent on
        becomming a lawyer. Then that changed to teaching. And teaching was interesting, but
        not a passion. Alison found more pleasure in taking things apart and fixing them than
        she did in trying to negotiate problems in a giant, bureaucracy such as *Fake Name*
        Unified School District. She decided it was time to move onto something that
        was equally challenging and rewarding, and that something happened to be web development.</p>
       <br>

      <p>Alison took a class at Austin Coding Academy and decided to continue her learning trajectory,
        finishing the intermediate class, and eventually the advanced class. She is currently a video game
        developer for Rooster Teeth in Austin, Texas. she lives with her 2 blind pugs.</p>
