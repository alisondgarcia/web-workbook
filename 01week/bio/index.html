      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I came to Austin, Texas from Watsonville, California, in search of adventure, freedom, and all of the other stuff they sing about in the Firefly intro.</p>
      <p>Most of my direct work experience is in teaching and working with youth; I worked in Oakland Unified School District, Orinda, and
      Berkeley California schools with students from all ages and backgrounds. Teaching was challenging and interesting, although I dreamed of doing creative work, and started to transition to that through copywriting and editing.</p>
      <p>I excell in team environments where I can fasciliatate direct communication. I'm blunt, and maybe too serious in spite of my hair color.

      <h3>Why I am Learning how to Code</h3>
      <p>I have a fierce sense of aesthetic beauty that I've honed on personal artistic projects such as painting and digital illustration.
      I hope to apply my sense of color, balance, and appreciation of art to front-end engineering projects with an emphasis in user design.</p>
      <p>Someone needs to make open-source projects beautiful, might as well be me.</p>
      <p>I also hope to make video games.</p>
